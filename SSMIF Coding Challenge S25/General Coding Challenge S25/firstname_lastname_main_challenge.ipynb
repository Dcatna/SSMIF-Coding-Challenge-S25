    "For this challenge, you are given various stocks and then are also given an ETF. However, when you open up the data, you will notice that the data is a little messy. Your first job is to clean the data before you work with it. Your goal for this problem is to find all potential mispricings in the ETF and areas where you can capture a profitable position. After you have finished, you are required to summarize your thought process behind your code. Your goal is not to calculate the profit and loss of your trades, but track the places where you see a opportunity to profit. (This could be having a short or long position). A completed project would consist of the following:\n",
    "- Graph of ETF with blue and red arrows indicating where you would ideally enter a position or close a position.\n",
    "- Summary describing what specific types of traders would be ideal in that situation and where you think the ETF was mispriced.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be graded on how well-written your code is, the strategies you come up with, and your overall documentation. The only packages that you are allowed to implement are pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. These packages are completely optional to use. AI is allowed as long as you document where you use it. Finally, documentation is required and typing is highly recommended.  Happy coding :)"
