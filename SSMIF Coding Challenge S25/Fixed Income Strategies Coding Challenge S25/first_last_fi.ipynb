    "Directions: For part 1 of this challenge, you will be given a dataset of annualized yields that correspond to bonds of different maturities. Each bond also has multiple yields that span the years 2015-2025. The bonds pay coupons at a semi-annual rate. You will be generating spot rates from these coupon rates using bootstrapping. For part 2, you will  construct an interest rate model to forecast the short-term price evolution as well as calculate duration and convexity to price bonds. More detail is given in each of the parts below. Feel free to add any additional helper functions where you see fit."

    "In the first part, your goal is to utilize bootstrapping to obtain the spot rate for each bond at each point in time. You will be using the data 'yield_data.csv' which contains the coupon rates and prices for each bond. The spot rate (also known as the zero rate) is the rate of return that the investor earns without collecting coupon payments. Bootstrapping is a method used for obtaining spot rates for fixed-income instruments that pay coupons. Using these spot rates, you are to generate a spot rate curve for each year (so 11 total spot rate curves). Note down any insights you observe.\n",

    "\n",
    "bootstrapped_rates: For every bond, calculate the zero rate using the bootstrapping method. For example, you will have to get the spot rate for the 1 year from 2015, the 2 year from 2015, etc until and including the bonds from the last year (2025). You can choose how you want to return these rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "plot_spot: For each year, plot out the rates you obtained from bootstrapped_rates. You will have to do this for each year (all bonds from 2015, 2016, etc), so you should have 11 graphs total."
